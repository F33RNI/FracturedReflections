## ‚ö†Ô∏è Rules

### 1. Install the Resource Pack

- The map includes a custom resource pack that must be installed by default (resources.zip).
- Verify proper installation: you should **NOT** see oak signs at spawn.

### 2. Enable Sounds and Music

- Turn ON all sounds and music in the game settings.
    Note: Each chapter has custom music triggered by command blocks. Avoid exiting the world or setting the music volume to 0.
- If the music stops playing for any reason, you can manually restart it with the following command:

    ```text
    /playsound minecraft:music.custom.<track_name> music @s ~ ~ ~ <volume 0-1>
    ```

    Example:

    ```text
    /playsound minecraft:music.custom.lost_in_the_firmament music @s ~ ~ ~ 0.8
    ```

- Play with headphones or high-quality speakers.

### 3. Adjust Video Settings

- **Render Distance:** 12 chunks
- **Simulation Distance:** 12 chunks
- **Entity Distance:** 70 - 110
- **Shaders:** Use Complementary Reimagined or a similar shader. Adjust performance settings within the shaders menu if needed.
- Disable clouds in the settings (and in shaders).

### 4. Play Fair

- Do not cheat.
- **Softlock Exception:** If you encounter a softlock, you may use /gamemode creative or /gamemode spectator to resolve the issue. Return to the adventure mode afterward.

### 5. Avoid Zoom Features

- Mods or tools that allow zooming are prohibited to preserve the intended experience.
